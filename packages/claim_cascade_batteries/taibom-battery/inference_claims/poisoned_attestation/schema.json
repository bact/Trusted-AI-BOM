By referencing poisoning event details such as the type of poisoning (e.g. mislabelling attack, data injection, data manipulation, etc.), the date and severity, this schema ensures a structured way to document and track reported data poisoning events.\n\n### Description\nThis schema includes:\n- **Type**: The attestation type, set to \"Poisoning\".\n- **Poisoning Details**: Provides details of the data poisoning event, including poisoning type, date, severity & description.\n\n## Use Case\n\nThe **Poisoning Attestation Schema** is used to:\n1. **Document Poisoning events**: Attach details of poisoning events to attestations for components.\n2. **Track Poisoning**: Keep track of components which have been poisoned and trace which other components this affects.\n3. **Support Compliance**: Ensure that poisoned components are tracked and managed in line with security standards.\n\nThis schema promotes transparency and accountability, ensuring that data poisoning event information is communicated clearly across software supply chains and trace if a data poisoning event compromises any components in that supply chain.\n"
