By referencing vulnerability details such as CVE or GHSA identifiers, this schema ensures a structured way to document and track vulnerabilities in software components.\n\n### Description\nThis schema includes:\n- **Type**: The attestation type, set to \"Vulnerability\".\n- **Vulnerability Details**: Provides details of the vulnerability, including identifiers, severity, description, and fixed versions.\n\n## Use Case\n\nThe **Vulnerability Attestation Schema** is used to:\n1. **Document Vulnerabilities**: Attach vulnerability details to attestations for components.\n2. **Track Remediation**: Keep track of versions and patches that address the vulnerability.\n3. **Support Compliance**: Ensure that vulnerable components are tracked and managed in line with security standards.\n\nThis schema promotes transparency and accountability, ensuring that vulnerability information is communicated clearly across software supply chains.\n",
