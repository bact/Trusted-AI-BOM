    "context": "## Introduction\n\nThe **Code Schema** is a JSON schema designed to define and standardise the representation of code or packages used within an AI system in the Trusted AI BOM (TAIBOM) ecosystem. This schema ensures traceability, integrity verification, and association with SBOMs for AI system components.\n\n### Description\nThis schema captures essential metadata for code or packages, including:\n- **Name**: The name of the code or package.\n- **Version**: The version of the code or package.\n- **Location**: Specifies where the code is stored, either locally or remotely, with a defined path or URL.\n- **Hash**: An object containing:\n  - `value`: The cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the code for data integrity verification.\n  - `location`: (Optional) Where the hash is stored, either locally or remotely.\n- **SBOM**: An object containing:\n  - `id`: The unique identifier of the SBOM (e.g., a VC ID or DID).\n  - `hash`: The cryptographic hash of the SBOM for verification.\n\n## Use Case\n\nThe **Code Schema** is primarily used within the TAIBOM framework to:\n1. **Document Code or Packages**: Provide a standardised representation of code used in AI systems.\n2. **Ensure Code Integrity**: Enable integrity verification through cryptographic hashes and their associated locations.\n3. **Link Code to SBOMs**: Establish a connection between the code and its SBOM for enhanced traceability and security.\n\nBy adopting this schema, organisations can maintain reliable and secure records of code used in AI systems, supporting transparency and robust lifecycle management.\n\n---\n",
