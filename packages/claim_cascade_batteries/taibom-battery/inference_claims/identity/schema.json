    "context": "## Introduction\n\nThe **Identity Schema** is a JSON schema designed to establish and standardise the representation of an individual's identity within the Trusted AI BOM (TAIBOM) framework. By associating a name, email, UUID, public key, and a role, this schema enables robust and secure identification of individuals who can make claims and attestations in AI systems.\n\n### Description\nThis schema ties an individual identity to:\n- **Name**: A human-readable identifier.\n- **Email**: A contact email address.\n- **UUID**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) that resolves to this identity.\n- **Public Key**: A path to cryptographic public key used to authenticate claims and attestations.\n- **Role**: A human-readable description of the individual's role.\n\n## Use Case\n\nThe **Identity Schema** is primarily used within the TAIBOM ecosystem to:\n1. **Establish Identity**: Provide a standardised identity format for individuals interacting with AI systems.\n2. **Enable Trust**: Facilitate secure claims and attestations through the binding of a public key to an individual.\n3. **Support Role-Based Operations**: Incorporate human-readable roles for context in organisational or system-level operations.\n\nBy using this schema, developers and system administrators can ensure that each identity is uniquely tied to a UUID and public key, bolstering the authenticity and security of interactions within AI systems.\n\nAdopting the **Identity Schema** helps organisations participating in TAIBOM achieve secure and trustworthy interactions in AI-driven ecosystems.\n\n---\n",
