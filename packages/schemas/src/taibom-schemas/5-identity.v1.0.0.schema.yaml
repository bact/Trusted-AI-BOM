  ## Introduction

  The **Identity Schema** is a JSON schema designed to establish and standardise the representation of an individual's identity within the Trusted AI BOM (TAIBOM) framework. By associating a name, email, UUID, public key, and a role, this schema enables robust and secure identification of individuals who can make claims and attestations in AI systems.

  ### Description
  This schema ties an individual identity to:
  - **Name**: A human-readable identifier.
  - **Email**: A contact email address.
  - **UUID**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) that resolves to this identity.
  - **Public Key**: A path to cryptographic public key used to authenticate claims and attestations.
  - **Role**: A human-readable description of the individual's role.

  ## Use Case

  The **Identity Schema** is primarily used within the TAIBOM ecosystem to:
  1. **Establish Identity**: Provide a standardised identity format for individuals interacting with AI systems.
  2. **Enable Trust**: Facilitate secure claims and attestations through the binding of a public key to an individual.
  3. **Support Role-Based Operations**: Incorporate human-readable roles for context in organisational or system-level operations.

  By using this schema, developers and system administrators can ensure that each identity is uniquely tied to a UUID and public key, bolstering the authenticity and security of interactions within AI systems.

  Adopting the **Identity Schema** helps organisations participating in TAIBOM achieve secure and trustworthy interactions in AI-driven ecosystems.
