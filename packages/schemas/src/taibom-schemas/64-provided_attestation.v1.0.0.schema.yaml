  ## Introduction

  The **Provided Attestation Schema** is a JSON schema designed to describe and standardise the relationship between the identity who provided a particular TAIBOM component and the associated component within the Trusted AI BOM (TAIBOM) ecosystem. This schema ensures the provider of a component can be identified and used to establish the provenance of components.

  ### Description
  This schema captures essential information for the provided` relationship, including:
  - **Component**: The component being attested to as being provided by the associated identity, identified by a unique ID and its associated hash.
  - **provider**: The provider being attested to as being the provider of the component

  ## Use Case

  The **Provided Attestation Schema** is primarily used within the TAIBOM framework to:
  1. **Enable Provenance Traceability**: Provide a clear and standardised method to establish which identities were involved in providing TAIBOM components
  2. **Enable Whitelisting/Blacklisting of providers**: Provides a mechanism to whitelist/blacklist providers and determine if components and their constituents meet your requirements 

  By adopting this schema, organisations can standardise a method of communicating who provided components, which can be used to determine all identities who contributed to an AI system and it's constituent components (data, weights, code etc.)
