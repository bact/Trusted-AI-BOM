title: Biased Attestation
description: |
  This schema extends the generic Attestation Schema to define an attestation that a component is biased
type: object
properties:
  component:
    type: object
    description: Component reference, including an ID and hash for the VC claim.
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: The component ID (unique identifier) of the VC claim.
      hash:
        type: string
        description: Cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) for verifying the integrity of the VC claim.
    required:
      - id
      - hash

  attestation:
    type: object
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        enum:
          - biased
        description: Type of attestation, set to "Biased" for this schema.
      bias:
        type: object
        description: The bias that applies to the particular component
        properties:
          types:
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
              description: The type of bias (e.g. selection bias, label bias, measurement bias, historical bias, exclusion bias)
          severity:
            type: string
            description: Severity of the bias (e.g., minor annoyance vs. critical ethical concern).
          context:
            type: string
            description: where and how the bias was observed (e.g., a specific AI-driven hiring system, chatbot, facial recognition software).
          impact:
            type: string
            description: The real-world consequences of the bias (e.g., unfair loan denials, inaccurate medical predictions).
          description:
            type: string
            description: Description of the bias
        required:
          - types
    required:
      - type
      - bias

required:
  - component
  - attestation

examples:
  - component:
      id: urn:uuid:222e3337-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174004
      hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0
    attestation:
      type: biased
      bias:
        types: ["algorithmic bias", "measurement bias", "historical bias"]
        impact: Black defendants were more likely to be classified as high-risk falsely (false positives) and white defendants were more likely to be classified as low-risk falsely (false negatives).
        severity: high
        context: The COMPAS algorithm was used in U.S. courts to assist in bail, sentencing, and parole decisions.
        description: The COMPAS algorithm disproportionately labels Black defendants as higher risk than White defendants, despite similar actual recidivism rates.

  ## Introduction

  The **Biased Attestation Schema** extends the generic Attestation Schema to enable attestations related to bias. By referencing bias details such as the types of bias (e.g.  selection bias, label bias, measurement bias, historical bias, exclusion bias, etc.), severity, context, impact and description, this schema ensures a structured way to document and track reported cases of bias events.

  ### Description
  This schema includes:
  - **Type**: The attestation type, set to "Bias".
  - **Bias Details**: Provides details of the bias, including types, severity, context, impact and description.

  ## Use Case

  The **Bias Attestation Schema** is used to:
  1. **Document Bias**: Attach details of reported bias to attestations for components.
  2. **Track Bias**: Keep track of components which have been reported to exhibit bias and trace which other components this affects.
  3. **Support Compliance**: Ensure that biased components are tracked and managed in line with ethical, procedural and compliance standards.

  This schema promotes transparency and accountability, ensuring that reports of bias are communicated clearly across software supply chains.
