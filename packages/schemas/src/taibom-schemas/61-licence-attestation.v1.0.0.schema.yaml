  ## Introduction

  The **License Attestation Schema** is a JSON schema that extends the generic Attestation Schema to define license-related attestations. By removing extraneous fields, this schema focuses solely on the attestation type and license text, simplifying its use for licensing documentation.

  ### Description
  This schema includes:
  - **Type**: The attestation type, set to "License".
  - **License**: A free-text field for specifying the license information or text.

  ## Use Case

  The **License Attestation Schema** is used to:
  1. **Document Licensing Information**: Provide a minimalistic yet formal structure for recording license details.
  2. **Support Compliance**: Ensure straightforward documentation of licensing requirements for components.
  
  By focusing only on essential fields, this schema simplifies license documentation while maintaining clarity and consistency.
