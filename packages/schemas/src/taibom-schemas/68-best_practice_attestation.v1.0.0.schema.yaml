  ## Introduction

  The **Best Practice Attestation Schema** extends the generic Attestation Schema to enable attestations related to best practice. By referencing best practice details such as the types of best practice followed and has the flexibility for other details about the best practice measures taken to be recorded.

  ### Description
  This schema includes:
  - **Type**: The attestation type, set to "Best_Practice".
  - **Best Practice Details**: Provides details of the types of best practice followed, with free form option to include relevant details.

  ## Use Case

  The **Best practice Attestation Schema** is used to:
  1. **Document Best practice**: Attach details of how best practice was followed to produce TAIBOM components, such as production of data, training of models and validation of trained models.
  2. **Track Adherence to Best Practice Recommendations**: Keep track of components which have been reported to have been produced following best practice and trace whether best practice recommendations have been followed through the supply chain of producing an AI system.

  This schema promotes transparency and accountability, ensuring that best practice has been followed through the supply chain.
