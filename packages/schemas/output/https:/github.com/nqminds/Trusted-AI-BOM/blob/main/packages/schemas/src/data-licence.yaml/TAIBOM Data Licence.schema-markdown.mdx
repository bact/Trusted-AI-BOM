# TAIBOM Data Licence

Declaration that a particular piece of data has a license. There are two variants  - for external references and hashed license.
This captures constraints that the data provider/owner/contributor places on the use of the data (e.g. may not be used in the creation of weapons systems)


The schema defines the following properties:

## `name` (string, required)

Human readable name of TAIBOM data licencing

## `data` (string, required)

Hash of the data used in training an AI system.

## `licence` (string, required)

The hash value representing the license associated with the data.
