# TAIBOM Design principles 

TAIBOM has been designed with the following design principles in mind



## Data centric security

As per Wikipedia definition

> **Data-centric security** is an approach to security that emphasizes the dependability of the [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) itself rather than the security of [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)), or applications.

TAIBOM adopts this principle. 

The security attributes of the data which are pertinent to its evaluation are explicitly within the data fragments, rather than being and implicitly attribute of the data connection methods

Specifically this means things such as 

* integrity: has the data been tampered with
* provenance: where has the data come from
* timing: when was the statement made/received 

These security attributes are provided through the verifiable credential wrapper, not the network or application bearer technology
