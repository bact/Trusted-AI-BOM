TAIBOM is evolving rapidly.

The current release has been designed to address single instance neural networks and the complex dependencies that lie within.

However, ai is evolving at a rapid rate, and the complexities of the systems, therefore, that need describing. are evolving quickly.

The following areas are actively being researched for TAIBOM extension potential

## Derived models 

First we have derived models. Derived models are essentially any ai system that is, Algorithmically dependent upon the base model. Common example is divide models are fine tuning. or distillation and compression.

A derived a clearly Inhabits security risks from its parents. Therefore, the Thai bomb derivation descriptors are, highly applicable to this problem.

## Multi Agent

Multiagent ai systems are the current cutting edge of ai development. Multi agent systems.
