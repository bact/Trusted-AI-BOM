#  Labelling/Versioning

Every aspect of a complex AI system needs labelling and versioning. (data, code and physical systems). Ideally there should be a method of attesting to the version. There can be various trust models to implement this

# Dependencies

A complex AI system has dependencies that need describing to fully understand provenance. TAIBOM will provide an interoperable method of describing these dependencies 

#  Attestation

Any actor (author or third party) can provide descriptors for each component of the system as a whole. (e.g. a training content review, as SBOM validation, a system integrity check, a fairness assessment). 

TAIBOM provides both a mechanism of making these attestations, but also a framework for the dynamic and subjective evaluation, of combinations of these attestations.
