## Inference use cases



An AI system is described and versioned by the component and aggregation claims. 

Individual component or the entire system can be future annotated by attestation claims.



At an operational level complex queries can be run, which essential dynamically implement policy at the AI system

We list out some examples below





## Data tampering check 

The integrity of training and configuration data can be checked by

1. Validating the configuration claim at the local AI inference system
2. Recomputing the local hash of the configuration data
3. Ensuring the two pieces of information match 



## Local vulnerability test

Local software can be tested for vulnerabilities as follows 

1. Validating the configuration claim at the local AI inference system
2. Recomputing the local hash of the configuration data
3. Ensuring the two pieces of information match
